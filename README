This test application is to get CPU and memory read/write performance.

- Calculate ackermann function to put a load on CPU.
- To be executed memory write, write result of ackermann function to allocated memory.
- To be executed memory read, read value from allocated memory, get residue of each value and
  and get summation of all value.
